## About me

I am a researcher in mathematics, specializing in algebraic geometry, with a particular focus on algebraic surfaces and foliations.
[[Here]](file/CV_of_Shi_Xu_徐识_.pdf) is my CV.

Since March 2025, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center (YMSC) at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.

I completed my PhD at East China Normal University in 2024, under the supervision of Professor [Shengli Tan](https://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~sltan/). 
My dissertation is titled “Double Coverings of Foliated Surfaces and the Slopes".
