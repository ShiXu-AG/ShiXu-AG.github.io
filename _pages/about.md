<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Post-doctoral researcher at the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center (YMSC) at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. 
My area of interest is algebraic geometry. In particular, I am interested in  algebraic surfaces and foliations.

I obtained my Ph.D. at East China Normal University (ECNU), supervised by Professor [Shengli Tan](https://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~sltan/). 

Here is a copy of my [[CV]](file/CV_of_Shi_Xu_徐识_.pdf).
